_Note: I tried two different coloring schemes in the "Medicaid vs. Medicare coverage, by county (sorted by percent (%) public coverage of total population)" visualization. The bottom coloring scheme is based off of U.S. Census Bureau-designated regions. Region 1, the Northeast (colored BLUE), encompasses New England (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont) and the Mid-Atlantic (New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. Region 2, the Midwest (colored YELLOW), encompasses East North Central (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin) and West North Central (Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota). Region 3, the South (colored RED, covers the South Atlantic (Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, District of Columbia, and West Virginia), the East South Central (Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee), and the West South Central (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas). Region 4 is the West (colored GREEN, which contains the Mountain (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming) and the Pacific regions (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington)._
